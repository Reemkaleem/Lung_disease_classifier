# Lung Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the automatic classification of lung diseases using deep learning techniques. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze chest X-ray images and predict whether the lungs are normal or affected by diseases such as Pneumonia or Tuberculosis. The goal is to assist in early and accurate diagnosis using medical imaging.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using a CNN architecture with the following components:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- MaxPooling layers for downsampling
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Dense layers for classification
- Softmax activation for multi-class output
